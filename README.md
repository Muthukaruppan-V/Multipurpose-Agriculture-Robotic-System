# Multipurpose-Agriculture-Robotic-System

Indiaâ€™s agricultural sector faces various challenges, including the adoption of sustainable production methods to improve yields and efficiency. Traditional farming methods demand intensive manual labor, which has become increasingly scarce due to aging rural workforce and growing urban migration. The objective of this paper is to use automated technology which can increase yield while requiring less labor and lower cost. The use of large agricultural machines leads to soil compaction, which obstructs root growth and decreases crop yield due to the low absorption of nutrients and water. To address this issue, a Multipurpose Agricultural Robotic System (MARS) has been developed that is both lightweight and affordable, unlike other existing technologies that perform tasks sequentially. The Raspberry Pi 4B serves as the robot's main microcontroller.It comes with a DHT11 sensor to accurately measure ground temperature and humidity levels. This robot has the potential to revolutionize agriculture by introducing a modern approach to traditional methods. This innovation aims to support farmers by offering more sustainable and productive harvests.
